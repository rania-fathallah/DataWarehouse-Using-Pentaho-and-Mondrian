# DataWarehouse Using Pentaho and Mondrian

For this project, I selected the 'sales-data-sample.csv' file as the initial dataset. To gain experience in data preprocessing and ETL (Extract, Transform, Load), I intentionally introduced imperfections into the relatively clean data. The ETL process was managed using Pentaho, a comprehensive data integration platform. Subsequently, I visualized the cleaned data using Mondrian, an OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) engine, to analyze the dataset from multiple perspectives.


More information about how the project was exactly executed and how it worked is found on the Report.pdf file.

The Schema of the DataWarehouse is found on Schhema.pdf and every part of the project is devided in various files.
